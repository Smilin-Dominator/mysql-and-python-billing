# MySQL and Python Billing

### I made this random program to test out if I could extract data from a MySQL Server
### And Add Them All And Get The Balance. And it succeeded! After 3 Days of trying I gave up on it
### But then randomly picked it up 3 weeks later, and fixed the bugs!<br>

# How To Use It?

### To Use it, replace my dummy SQL Creds with your SQL Server credentials, the Query and the Array to your need. (connectory.py)
### price.py and main.py are fine by themselves!
